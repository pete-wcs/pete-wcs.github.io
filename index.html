                    Thank you to everyone who has pledged to support the community shop and post office.
                    So far we have pledges for just under £27,000 from 70 people. Our target is to raise £30,000
                    and we are delighted that so many people want to be a part of this new venture. We would like to
                    increase the number of shareholders to 100 and raise a further £3000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The share offer is now open and will run until Monday 11th February 2019. If you missed the chance to pledge,
                    you can still buy shares. Shareholders will become members of the Shop society and have a say in how the shop is
                    run. You only need to buy one share at £25.00 each to have full voting rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our plans for the transfer of ownership are progressing well and we hope to have everything in place to
                    take over the running of the shop in March.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Steering Group have put together a Business Plan setting out the plans and financial forecasts for the shop.
